# PantherBot - GSU Smart Program Assistant ðŸŽ“ðŸ¤–

## Project Overview
PantherBot is an AI-powered chatbot developed to assist students in exploring undergraduate and graduate programs at Georgia State University (GSU).  
By integrating OpenAI's LLM capabilities with real-time data from GSU's program listings, PantherBot offers quick, intelligent responses to help students find the right program based on their interests.

This project was created as part of the MSA 8700 course, focusing on designing, developing, and deploying an AI business solution using large language models (LLMs).
